**This repository is a showcase of my learning journey as I explore the world of data science with Jupyter Notebooks.**
The repository consists of:

**Airbnb listings**
  
Goal: Identify trends in listings managed by prospective professional hosts for an international real estate firm.

Approach:
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Applied principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and clustering to segment the data.
Investigated pricing trends and their relationship to key features.

Result: Delivered actionable insights on optimizing pricing strategies and understanding professional listing patterns.

**Movie Recommendation System**
  
Goal: Create Movie Recommendation system
Approach:
Implemented feature engineering and preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality.
Applied various machine learning algorithms and optimized model performance (xgboost, RandomizedSearchCV)

Result: Building an effective recommender system and identifying important features (MAPE 0.1829).

**Air Quality: Pollution Analysis and Modeling (Under Development)**

Objective: Analyze and predict air pollution levels using global air quality data

Current Development Stages: 
1. Data Collection and Analysis:
Utilized SQL queries and API requests to retrieve air quality data for multiple countries.
Conducted extensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis to uncover pollution trends and regional variations.
Visualized pollutant distributions to highlight key environmental patterns.
2. Forecasting Models:
Developing predictive models to forecast pollutant concentrations over time.
Exploring advanced techniques to improve forecasting accuracy and address data limitations.
